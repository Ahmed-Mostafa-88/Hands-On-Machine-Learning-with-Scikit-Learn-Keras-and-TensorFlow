## Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project

Welcome to Machine Learning Housing Corp.! Your task is to predict median house values in Californian districts, given a number of features from these districts.

This notebook contains the sample code in chapter 2.

### Setup

First, let's import a few common modules, ensure MatplotLib plots figures inline, and prepare a function to save the figures. We also check that Python 3.5 or later is installed (although Python 2.x may work, it is deprecated, so we strongly recommend you use Python 3 instead), as well as Scikit-Learn ≥0.20.

### Load the Data

We start by loading the dataset, which contains information about various districts in California. This dataset includes features such as the median income, median house value, and geographical coordinates.

### Visualize the Data

Before diving into the modeling, it's crucial to understand the data by visualizing it. We create histograms to observe the distribution of various features and scatter plots to explore the relationships between different attributes.

### Split the Data

To evaluate the model's performance accurately, we split the data into a training set and a test set. This ensures that we can validate the model on data it hasn't seen before, providing a better estimate of its real-world performance.

### Discover and Visualize the Data to Gain Insights

Next, we perform a more detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA). This includes creating correlation matrices to identify relationships between features and the target variable, as well as creating visualizations to uncover patterns and insights.

### Prepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms

Data preparation is a critical step. We handle missing values, convert categorical data into numerical formats, and scale the features to ensure that the model performs well. This step often includes creating pipelines for efficient data transformation.

### Select and Train a Model

We then select a model to train. This involves choosing an algorithm, training it on the prepared data, and evaluating its performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).

### Evaluate the Model

Evaluation is crucial to understand how well the model performs. We use various performance metrics to evaluate the model on the training data and test data, ensuring it generalizes well to unseen data.

### Fine-Tune Your Model

Finally, we fine-tune the model by optimizing its hyperparameters. This involves techniques such as grid search and cross-validation to find the best combination of parameters that improve the model's performance.
